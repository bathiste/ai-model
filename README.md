# SIF — Security Inert Framework (WIP)

**SIF** (Security Inert Framework) is a cutting-edge, unrestricted AI framework designed to perform tasks comparable to world-leading AI models. It has been optimized for **small-scale hardware**, enabling advanced AI functionalities on lightweight systems while prioritizing security and privacy.

---

## Features

- **No filters / unrestricted AI:** Capable of performing all tasks that mainstream AI systems can handle, without pre-applied content restrictions.  
- **Optimized for small computers:** Runs efficiently on lightweight machines without sacrificing performance.  
- **Privacy-first design:** Ensures **no data leaks**; all processing is local.  
- **Flexible use cases:** Supports a wide variety of AI-driven tasks, from natural language processing to automation and research simulations.  
- **Self-contained:** Requires no external data storage or third-party APIs by default.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bathiste/ai-model.git
cd sif
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy nnfs matplotlib
```

*(Optimized for Python 3.11+)*

3. Run SIF:

WIP:
latest version is in ai-model\AI PROJECT GROUND ZERO - SIF\personal files for knowledge\tests on the pdf\optimization(2).py

## Usage

SIF can be used via a command-line interface or integrated into your Python projects:

```python
from sif import SIF

ai = SIF()
response = ai.ask("Summarize the latest AI research paper")
print(response)
```
